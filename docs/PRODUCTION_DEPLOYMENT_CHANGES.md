# Production Deployment Changes

## Summary

Made production-ready changes to hide new wallet payment features behind a feature flag while preparing for deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Footer - Buy Me a Coffee Layout ✅

**File**: `src/components/Footer.tsx`

**Changed**:
- Condensed "Buy me a coffee" section into a single row
- Reduced font sizes and padding
- Removed Highlighter from excessive highlighting
- Made ETH address and copy button inline
- Simplified layout for better mobile responsiveness

**Before**: Large multi-line section with prominent Highlighter
**After**: Compact single-row design with address and copy button side-by-side

### 2. Services Page - Feature Flag for Wallet Payments ✅

**File**: `src/app/services/page.tsx`

**Added Feature Flag**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PAYMENTS`

**When flag is `false` (default)**:
- Shows pricing packages directly (no wallet gate)
- Hides "Pay Deposit & Skip Queue" button
- Removes deposit-related text
- Shows only "Free Discovery Call" button

**When flag is `true`**:
- Shows `ServicePaymentGate` component (wallet-based unlock)
- Shows "Pay Deposit & Skip Queue" button
- Shows deposit explanation text
- Full wallet payment functionality enabled

### 3. Environment Variables ✅

**File**: `.env.example`

**Added**:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PAYMENTS=false  # Enable wallet-based payment gating on services page
```

**Also includes Supabase variables** (for when you enable the feature):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_public_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_secret_key
```

## Deployment Checklist

### For Production (Now)

- [ ] Ensure `.env.local` does **NOT** have `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PAYMENTS` or sets it to `false`
- [ ] Build the project: `task build`
- [ ] Test locally: `task start`
- [ ] Verify services page shows pricing directly (no wallet prompt)
- [ ] Verify footer coffee section is compact
- [ ] Deploy to production

### For Testing Wallet Features (Later)

When you're ready to test the wallet payment system:

1. **Set up Supabase**:
   - Create project at supabase.com
   - Run SQL from `docs/WALLET_PAYMENT_SETUP.md`
   - Get credentials and add to `.env.local`

2. **Enable feature flag**:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PAYMENTS=true
   ```

3. **Test on devnet** first:
   ```env
   SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
   ```

4. **Verify**:
   - Visit `/services`
   - Should see wallet connection prompt
   - Connect wallet (Phantom/Solflare)
   - Should see payment QR code
   - Test payment flow

## File Summary

### Modified Files
- `src/components/Footer.tsx` - Condensed coffee section
- `src/app/services/page.tsx` - Added feature flag checks
- `.env.example` - Added wallet payments flag

### New Files (from earlier work)
- `src/components/payments/ServicePaymentGate.tsx`
- `src/components/payments/PaymentModal.tsx`
- `src/components/wallet/WalletProvider.tsx`
- `src/components/wallet/WalletButton.tsx`
- `src/lib/supabase/*` (client, server, auth, payments)
- `src/actions/wallet-action.ts`
- `docs/WALLET_PAYMENT_SETUP.md`
- `docs/WALLET_AUTH_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/NPM_PACKAGE_STRATEGY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Testing

### Test with Flag OFF (default)
```bash
# Make sure flag is false or not set
grep NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PAYMENTS .env.local

# Build and test
task build
task start

# Visit http://localhost:3000/services
# Should show pricing directly without wallet gate
```

### Test with Flag ON
```bash
# Add to .env.local
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PAYMENTS=true" >> .env.local

# Restart dev server
task dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000/services
# Should show wallet connection prompt before pricing
```

## Production Deployment

The site is now safe to deploy with the wallet payment features hidden. All new functionality is behind the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PAYMENTS` feature flag.

**Command to deploy**:
```bash
# Ensure flag is not set or is false
unset NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PAYMENTS

# Or in your .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PAYMENTS=false

# Build
task build

# Deploy (your deployment command here)
# e.g., vercel deploy --prod
```

## Future Activation

When you're ready to enable wallet payments in production:

1. Set up Supabase production database
2. Add Supabase env vars to production
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PAYMENTS=true` in production env
4. Switch to mainnet Solana RPC
5. Monitor first payments carefully

**Status**: Ready for production deployment with wallet features disabled ✅
