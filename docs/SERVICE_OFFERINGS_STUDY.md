3. **Value Perception**: Enterprise buyers trust expensive consultants more
4. **Time Value**: Your time is limited; maximize revenue per hour

### Pricing Tiers Recommendation

**Good-Better-Best Strategy**:

| Service | Good | Better | Best |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| **Fractional CTO** | $12k/month (15hr) | $18k/month (25hr) | Custom engagement |
| **Technical Writing** | 1 article ($750) | 4 articles/month ($4k) | 8 articles/month ($8k) |
| **Case Study** | Mini ($3k) | Full ($6k-10k) | Series of 5 ($25k) |
| **Architecture Docs** | Audit ($2.5k) | Full docs ($10k) | Docs + Support ($8k/month) |
