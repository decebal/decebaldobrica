```

### 2. Create Payment Provider Files

### 3. Database Migration

Run SQL in Supabase:
```sql
-- Add payment fields to newsletter_subscribers

ADD COLUMN payment_provider TEXT,
ADD COLUMN subscription_interval TEXT,
ADD COLUMN next_billing_date TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Create payments tracking table
CREATE TABLE newsletter_payments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  subscriber_id UUID REFERENCES newsletter_subscribers(id),
  payment_provider TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(20, 8) NOT NULL,
  currency TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  -- ... (see full schema in NEWSLETTER_PREMIUM_PAYMENTS.md)
);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach

### MVP (Week 1-2): NOWPayments Only
**Fastest path to production**

**Pros:**
- Single integration handles ALL currencies (SOL, BTC, ETH, USDC + USD/GBP fiat)
- Built-in hosted checkout UI
- Webhook notifications included
- Lightning Network support
- Only ~1% fees (vs 3% Stripe)

**Implementation:**
1. Sign up: https://nowpayments.io
2. Get API key
3. Create payment â†’ get checkout URL
4. Handle webhook â†’ upgrade tier
5. Done!

**Code required:** ~200 lines total

### Advanced (Week 3-4): Hybrid Approach
**For power users who want 0% fees**

**Direct integrations:**
- Solana Pay for SOL (0% fees, you already have components)
- NOWPayments for BTC/ETH/USDC + fiat

**Benefits:**
- 0% fees for Solana payments
- Still have BTC/ETH/fiat fallback
- More control over UX

**Code required:** ~500 lines
