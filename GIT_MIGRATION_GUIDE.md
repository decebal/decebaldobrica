# Git Migration Guide: Monorepo Transition

**Goal:** Replace the old standalone repo with the new monorepo as the main codebase

**Old Repo:** `/Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-nextjs`
**New Repo:** `/Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-monorepo`

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Approach: Clean Branch Replacement

This preserves git history while clearly marking the monorepo migration.

### Step 1: Check Current Status

```bash
cd /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-monorepo

# Check git status
git status

# Check current branch
git branch

# Check remotes
git remote -v
```

### Step 2: Add Remote from Old Repo

```bash
# Add the old repo as a remote
git remote add old-repo /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-nextjs

# Fetch all branches and history
git fetch old-repo

# Verify
git remote -v
```

### Step 3: Create Migration Commit

```bash
# Make sure all monorepo files are committed
git add .
git status

# Create a comprehensive migration commit
git commit -m "feat: migrate to monorepo architecture

BREAKING CHANGE: Project restructured as Turborepo monorepo

### Step 4: Handle Remote Repository

**Option A: Replace Main Branch (Clean Transition)**

```bash
# IMPORTANT: This will replace the main branch history
# Make sure you have backups!

# Push to main with force (overwrites remote)
git push origin main --force

# Verify on GitHub/remote
```

**Option B: Create New Branch First (Safer)**

```bash
# Create a new branch for the monorepo
git checkout -b monorepo-migration

# Push the new branch
git push origin monorepo-migration

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
# Review changes, then merge to main
# This allows you to review before replacing main
```

**Option C: Keep Old History and Merge**

```bash
# Merge old repo history into monorepo
git merge old-repo/main --allow-unrelated-histories -m "chore: merge old repo history before monorepo migration"

# Create migration commit (as in Step 3)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: migrate to monorepo architecture..."

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

---

## üéØ Recommended Flow (Step by Step)

### 1. Verify Monorepo is Ready

```bash
cd /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-monorepo

# Test build
bun run build:web

# Test dev server
bun run dev:web

# Run linting
bun run lint

# If all passes, you're ready!
```

### 2. Commit All Monorepo Changes

```bash
# Check what needs to be committed
git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Create migration commit (see Step 3 above)
git commit -m "feat: migrate to monorepo architecture..."
```

### 3. Link to Old Repo (Preserve History)

```bash
# Add old repo as remote
git remote add old-repo /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-nextjs

# Fetch old history
git fetch old-repo

# Optional: Merge old history
git merge old-repo/main --allow-unrelated-histories -m "chore: preserve git history from standalone repo"
```

### 4. Push to Remote

**Safe approach (recommended for first time):**

```bash
# Create backup branch
git branch backup-before-monorepo

# Push backup
git push origin backup-before-monorepo

# Create monorepo branch
git checkout -b monorepo-migration

# Push monorepo branch
git push origin monorepo-migration

# Now go to GitHub and:
# 1. Review the changes in the PR
# 2. Merge to main when ready
# 3. Update default branch if needed
```

**Direct approach (if you're confident):**

```bash
# Push directly to main (overwrites)
git push origin main --force-with-lease

# The --force-with-lease is safer than --force
# It will fail if someone else pushed in the meantime
```

---

## üîÑ After Migration

### Update Local Working Directory

```bash
# Set the monorepo as your primary working directory
cd /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-monorepo

# Add this to your shell config (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
alias cdportfolio="cd /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-monorepo"
```

### Archive Old Repo

```bash
# Rename old directory to indicate it's archived
mv /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-nextjs \
   /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-nextjs-archived-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Or create a backup tarball
cd /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal
tar -czf portofolio-nextjs-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz portofolio-nextjs

# Then delete the old directory
rm -rf portofolio-nextjs
```

### Update Vercel/Deployment

If you're using Vercel:

1. **Go to your project settings**
2. **Update Root Directory:** Leave blank (monorepo root)
3. **Build settings:**
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Root Directory: `apps/web`
   - Build Command: `cd ../.. && bun run build:web`
   - Output Directory: `apps/web/.next`
   - Install Command: `bun install`

4. **Environment Variables:** Already copied to `apps/web/.env.local`

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Lost Commits?

```bash
# Git never truly deletes commits
# Find lost commits
git reflog

# Recover a commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
git checkout -b recovery-branch
```

### Need to Undo Force Push?

```bash
# On GitHub, check previous commits
# Find the commit hash before force push
# Force push back to that commit
git reset --hard <old-commit-hash>
git push origin main --force
```

### Merge Conflicts?

```bash
# If merging old history creates conflicts
git merge --abort

# Try with strategy
git merge old-repo/main --allow-unrelated-histories --strategy-option theirs
```

## üìã Pre-Migration Checklist

Before pushing to remote:

- [ ] Monorepo builds successfully (`bun run build:web`)
- [ ] Dev server works (`bun run dev:web`)
- [ ] All tests pass (`bun run test:e2e`)
- [ ] Environment variables copied to `apps/web/.env.local`
- [ ] All files committed (`git status` shows clean)
- [ ] Backup branch created
- [ ] Remote is correct (`git remote -v`)
- [ ] Team notified (if applicable)

---

## üéØ Recommended Command Sequence

Here's the exact sequence I recommend:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to monorepo
cd /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-monorepo

# 2. Check everything is committed
git status
git add .
git commit -m "feat: migrate to monorepo architecture

BREAKING CHANGE: Project restructured as Turborepo monorepo

See MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md for full details.
"

# 3. Test build
bun run build:web

# 4. Create backup
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 5. Add old repo remote (preserve history)
git remote add old-repo /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-nextjs
git fetch old-repo

# 6. Merge old history (optional but recommended)
git merge old-repo/main --allow-unrelated-histories -m "chore: preserve git history from standalone repo"

# 7. Push to main
git push origin main --force-with-lease

# 8. Verify on GitHub
# Open your repo URL in browser and verify

# 9. Update Vercel deployment settings
# Follow "Update Vercel/Deployment" section above

# 10. Archive old repo
mv /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-nextjs \
   /Users/decebaldobrica/Projects/personal/portofolio-nextjs-archived-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## üéâ Success!

After following these steps:

‚úÖ Your monorepo is now the main codebase
‚úÖ Git history is preserved (if you merged)
‚úÖ Old repo is safely archived
‚úÖ Deployment is updated
‚úÖ You can continue developing in the monorepo

**Next:** Start building Phase 2 of the newsletter system!

---

## üìù Notes

**Why `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force`?**
- `--force-with-lease` is safer
- It checks that no one else pushed in the meantime
- Prevents accidentally overwriting others' work

**Should I merge old history?**
- Yes, if you want to preserve commit history
- No, if you want a clean break (monorepo is the new start)
- Either way is valid, depends on your preference

**What about the old repo?**
- Keep it archived for reference
- Don't delete immediately
- Can remove after a few weeks of successful monorepo usage
