CONCISE SUMMARY for Case Study #4 - "From Overengineered to MVP — Launch in 12 Days"

Title (keep short):
From Overengineered to MVP — Launch in 12 Days

Tagline (one sentence):
Enterprise architecture transformation: TOGAF-aligned platform modernization in 12 days

problem (keep to 3-4 sentences, punchy):
Series A-backed FinEdge Premium Intelligence ($4.2M raised) faced critical delays launching their institutional newsletter.

The team **overengineered before validating**—Ghost CMS couldn't support multi-tier subscriptions, institutional SSO, or Bloomberg integrations.

**Mid-cycle pivot cost $85K, 14 weeks lost, competitors launched first.**

Impact (keep to 3-4 sentences):
**Financial:** $85K budget overrun, $127K lost revenue, 3.2x infrastructure costs.

**Operational:** 67% velocity drop, 47% technical debt, deployment frequency collapsed.

**Strategic:** Competitors captured 34% market share, board demanded architecture review, 7-9 weeks of runway remaining.

framework (one punchy sentence):
TOGAF ADM compressed into 12 days—enterprise architecture at startup speed.

actions (6 bullet points max, one line each):
• Established 7 architecture principles (modularity, cloud-first, security by design)
• Designed cloud-native stack: Next.js, Supabase, Vercel Edge, TypeScript strict mode
• 72-hour brand sprint with Base44 + lovable.dev (design-dev parallel track)
• AI-assisted development (Claude Code) for 40% productivity gain
• Built on ShadCN UI library—WCAG 2.1 AA compliance out of the box
• Automated CI/CD with 8 quality gates: testing (87% coverage), security, performance

outcomes (6 bullet points max, one line each):
• **12-day launch** (85% faster)—TOGAF planning + cloud-native stack
• **$38K cost** (69% cheaper)—managed services, AI coding, pre-built components
• **8% technical debt** (83% better)—TypeScript strict mode, automated testing, CI/CD gates
• **Lighthouse 98/100**—sub-1.2s loads, auto-scales 0→10K users
• **$18.4K MRR** in 30 days (127 subscribers)—exceeded projections by 23%
• **99.97% uptime**—auto-recovery <4 min, zero data loss

lesson (3-4 sentences max):
**Enterprise architecture accelerates startups when applied pragmatically.**

TOGAF compressed to startup timelines = documented decisions that align teams faster than meetings.

Cloud-native + AI-assisted development = enterprise reliability without DevOps staff.

prescriptions (6 bullet points max, one line each):
• Define architecture principles before technology selection—no resume-driven development
• TOGAF ADM Lite: compress Phases A-H into 1-2 weeks for startups
• Cloud-native stack: serverless, managed databases, edge networks, managed auth
• AI assistants (Claude Code, Copilot) + quality gates (code review, automated testing)
• Design agencies (Base44, lovable.dev) for 3-day sprints vs. 6-week in-house
• Component libraries (ShadCN UI)—custom design systems only at Series B+ scale
