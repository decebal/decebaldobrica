## Summary

Hands-on technology leader with 15+ years of experience building scalable fintech, SaaS, and Web3 systems. Currently leading engineering at Ebury, where I manage a cross-functional team of 10+ delivering event-driven architectures and migrating to a "you build it, you run it" operating model.

My expertise spans TypeScript, Rust, serverless, and blockchain, with a proven track record of scaling developer productivity by 3x and reducing cloud costs by 75%.

I'm focused on the intersection of blockchain efficiency and AI productivityâ€”optimizing smart contract and infrastructure performance while embedding GenAI workflows that accelerate development, testing, and delivery. I bring a pragmatic yet visionary approach to technical leadership: balancing resilience, cost efficiency, and speed, while mentoring teams to thrive in high-growth environments.

Now seeking a hands-on CTO role where I can architect resilient blockchain platforms, leverage AI to drive engineering efficiency, and align technical execution with business growth.
